Program Outcome Treemaps

Treemaps display heirarhical data as sets of nested rectangles, showing the relationship between commmon structures and the levels within them.  The nesting of the rectangles follows a Macro-Meso-Micro organization where the size of the higher levels are determined by the sum of the levels under them.

1. *Macro*: highest level grouping, also sets color.
2. *Meso*: second highest level.
3. *Micro*: lowest level.

In this case, the treemap is displaying the results of an engineering or engineering technology program by coding the program learning outcomes according to:

1. *Macro*: The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board's curriculum content measure: the Academic Unit and their related categories (Natural Science, Mathematics, Engineering Science, Engineering Design and Complementary Studies). 
2. *Meso*: The concept represented in each program learning outcome.
3. *Micro*: The verb used in each program learning outcome.

So in this map, highest (macro) level corresponds to the AU category, also setting the color of each group. The second highest (meso) level corresponds to the concept, and the smallest (micro) level corresponds to the verb.  

1. *Macro*: The highest level presents how how much each AU is represented in the learning outcomes. sized by the sum of the second highest level.
2. *Meso*: The second highest level presents the different concepts represented in each AU sized by the sum of smallest level.
3. *Micro*: The smallest level presents how often the verb is represented in each au-concept pairing, sized by the count of each verb from all of the program outcomes.
